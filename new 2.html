	<title> HTML Practice</title>
	<h1> First header of HTML</h1>
	<p> In this HTML, I will be writing a small paragraph and posting some images. Also, I will try add website link, create a table, create list items, Form for contact details, add some abbreviations, and quotations. These were the things that i learned in the first class of HTML. Though the class was of 1 hour, It took me almost 3 days (5 hours approx) to get to where I am today.</P>
	
	<br>
	<p>Some of the things that I have learned are to write <strong>bold text</strong>, write in <em>Italics</em>, add link for<a href="http://google.com"> website</a>, and to open the <a href="http://google.com" target="blank"> link</a> and on to the next tab. I learned to create the list with the bullet points. <br> 
<!-- Lists -->
	<ul>
		<li>This is first, but without number</li>
		<li>This is second, but without number</li>
		<li>This is third, but without number</li>	
	</ul>
	<ol>
		<li>This is first, but with number</li>
		<li>This is second, but with number</li>
		<li>This is third, but with number</li>	
	</ol>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>Creating Table was pretty cool. Heres the demo. The table provides the Name, age and email address of a person.</p>
	<!--Tables --> 
		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Email Address</th>
					<th>Age Group</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Riwaj Gautam</td>
					<td>gr7autam@gmail.com</td>
					<td>24</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Samita Adhikari</td>
					<td>ravishingsami@gmail.com</td>
					<td>21</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
